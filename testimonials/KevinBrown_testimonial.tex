{\it ``As a infectious disease epidemiologist working as a scientist at Public Health Ontario, I know the acute need for strong connections between the academic mathematical modeling community, public health, and government decision makers. At the BIRS-CANMOD meeting in November 2023, I made great connections that will support future public health responses to infectious disease threats, by supporting such connections. In addition to excellent applied presentations, we had beneficial discussions about how to strengthen public health surveillance data for respiratory infections, that could help support more robust forecasting of respiratory infections in the future.''}
