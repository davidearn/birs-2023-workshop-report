Title: Modelling Immunity

Jane Heffernan

Abstract: ‘Immunity’ is both a population- and an individual-level characteristic. We have developed individual- and population-level models of immunity using in-host modelling of vaccination, immune system and infection dynamics, and epidemiological models of disease spread and public health programming. In this talk, we will discuss the multi-level models of immunity and discuss their integration, which can be used to inform public health decision-makers. We will focus on COVID-19 in Ontario.
