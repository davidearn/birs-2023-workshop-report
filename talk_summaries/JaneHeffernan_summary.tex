\subsubsection*{Modelling Immunity}
\textit{Jane Heffernan, York University}

`Immunity' is both a population- and an individual-level characteristic. We have developed individual- and population-level models of immunity using in-host modelling of vaccination, immune system and infection dynamics, and epidemiological models of disease spread and public health programming. In this talk, we discussed the multi-level models of immunity and their integration, which can be used to inform public health decision-makers. We focused on COVID-19 in Ontario.
