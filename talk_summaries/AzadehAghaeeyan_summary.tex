\subsubsection*{Revealing the unseen: What portion of the Americans relied on others\textquotesingle{} satisfaction when deciding to take the COVID-19 vaccination}
\textit{Azadeh Aghaeeyan, Brock University}

Efficient coverage for newly developed vaccines requires knowing which
groups of individuals will accept the vaccine immediately and which will
take longer to accept or never accept.

In this study, we assumed that, within the context of COVID-19
vaccination, non-vaccine refuser Americans behaved as either
success-based learners, making decisions based on
others\textquotesingle{} satisfaction, or as myopic rationalists,
attending to their own immediate perceived benefit.

We used COVID-19 vaccination data to fit a mechanistic model capturing
the distinct effects of the two types on the vaccination progress.

We estimated that about half of Americans behaved as myopic rationalists
with a high variation across the states.

The proportion was correlated with the vaccination coverage, proportion
of votes in favor of Democrats in 2020 presidential election, and
education score.

The findings reveal the impact of the proportions of the decision-makers
on the vaccination speed and, consequently, overall vaccination
coverage.
