Hi David,
Here is my abstract.
Best,
Jane

Title: Modelling Immunity
Abstract: ‘Immunity’ is both a population- and an individual-level characteristic. We have developed individual- and population-level models of immunity using in-host modelling of vaccination, immune system and infection dynamics, and epidemiological models of disease spread and public health programming. In this talk, we will discuss the multi-level models of immunity and discuss their integration, which can be used to inform public health decision-makers. We will focus on COVID-19 in Ontario.

Dear Colleagues,

Thank you for participating in our CANMOD BIRS workshop from 12-17 Nov 2023.  We are writing with a few followup points:

No one objected to sharing their e-mail address with the full group, so a full list of all participants with their e-mail address and affiliation is attached.

We, the organizers, are required to write a 10-15 page report about the workshop.  This report will be placed permanently on the BIRS web site. 
BIRS workshop reports normally contain summaries of the presentations. 
Since we did not request abstracts in advance, we don't have summaries to work from.  Consequently, if you gave a presentation at the meeting, can you please send us a brief summary that can be included in the report? 
Please note that the report must be formatted in LaTeX, so please send LaTeX-compatible text if possible.  We would appreciate receiving this brief text within two weeks, i.e., by Monday 11 Dec 2023, if at all possible.  Thanks in advance!

Another common component of BIRS workshop reports comprises testimonials from participants about the workshop.  If you have comments that you would be comfortable appearing in the report, please also send them to us in a LaTeX-friendly format, preferably by 11 Dec 2023.  Again, thanks in advance.

Finally, if you attended in person and you have not already done so, please submit your travel claim to Mark Campbell at SFU.  You should have received an e-mail message from Mark at the end of the workshop.

Thanks again for participating in what worked out to be a very enjoyable and interesting meeting!

Best wishes,
David, Caroline and Irena
