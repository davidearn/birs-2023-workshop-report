Infectious disease (ID) models played an important role in decision
making during the COVID-19 pandemic. While ID modelling has methods to
address structural and parameter uncertainty, communicating decision
uncertainty is another important interface between ID modelers and
decision-makers. This talk presented the Decision Uncertainty Toolkit
aimed to address and develop methods for communicating uncertainty to
decision makers where there are multiple policy options. The toolkit
includes visualizations, risk measures, descriptions, and
interpretations.  As this work is on-going, we included an opportunity
for further involvement through a planned workshop in 2024 to try out
the tool and provide additional feedback on the codes, visualizations,
and descriptions.
