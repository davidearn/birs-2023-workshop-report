Hi David,


An abstract for my talk is below.


Antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised hosts

Prolonged infections of immunocompromised individuals have been proposed as a
crucial source of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Longitudinal sampling of SARS-CoV-2 from immunocompromised hosts reveals
evidence of accelerated adaptation relative to the wider population. In
principle, sustained within-host antigenic evolution in immunocompromised hosts
could allow novel immune escape variants to emerge more rapidly, but little is
known about how and when immunocompromised hosts play a critical role in
pathogen evolution. I will discuss how a relatively simple mathematical model
can provide powerful insights into the effects of immunocompromised hosts on the
emergence of immune escape variants. Specifically, when the pathogen does not
have to cross a fitness valley for immune escape to occur, a small number of
immunocompromised hosts have no qualitative effect on antigenic evolution at the
population-level. But if a fitness valley exists, then persistent infections of
immunocompromised individuals allow mutations to accumulate so that the fitness
valley can be traversed, thereby facilitating large jumps in antigenic space at
the population-level. Our results suggest that better genomic surveillance of
infected immunocompromised individuals and better global health equality,
including improving access to vaccines and treatments for individuals who are
immunocompromised (especially in lower- and middle-income countries), may help
to prevent the emergence of future immune escape variants of SARS-CoV-2.

Dear Colleagues,

Thank you for participating in our CANMOD BIRS workshop from 12-17 Nov
2023.  We are writing with a few followup points:

No one objected to sharing their e-mail address with the full group, so a
full list of all participants with their e-mail address and affiliation is
attached.

We, the organizers, are required to write a 10-15 page report about the
workshop.  This report will be placed permanently on the BIRS web site.
BIRS workshop reports normally contain summaries of the presentations.
Since we did not request abstracts in advance, we don't have summaries to
work from.  Consequently, if you gave a presentation at the meeting, can
you please send us a brief summary that can be included in the report?
Please note that the report must be formatted in LaTeX, so please send
LaTeX-compatible text if possible.  We would appreciate receiving this
brief text within two weeks, i.e., by Monday 11 Dec 2023, if at all
possible.  Thanks in advance!

Another common component of BIRS workshop reports comprises testimonials
from participants about the workshop.  If you have comments that you would
be comfortable appearing in the report, please also send them to us in a
LaTeX-friendly format, preferably by 11 Dec 2023.  Again, thanks in
advance.

Finally, if you attended in person and you have not already done so,
please submit your travel claim to Mark Campbell at SFU.  You should have
received an e-mail message from Mark at the end of the workshop.

Thanks again for participating in what worked out to be a very enjoyable
and interesting meeting!

Best wishes,
David, Caroline and Irena
