This five-day hybrid workshop featured several special sessions, 27 short (30 minute) talks from in-person participants, and one short talk from an online participant. 

Special sessions included an introduction to the Historic Disease Data Portal (\Cref{sec:iidda}), a discussion about challenges in infectious disease surveillence across Canada (\Cref{sec:surv-disc}), and a workshop on the \macpan modelling software (\Cref{sec:macpan}).

Short talks were grouped thematically in the schedule and spanned many domains, including behavioural modelling, infectious disease surveillence, pathogen evolution and genetics, vaccination and within-host immunity, policy-making in response to infectious disease outbreaks, as well as more general mathematical and statistical methods to support epidemiological modelling. \Cref{sec:short-talks} features summaries for several talks presented at the workshop. 

All talks were streamed live to online participants. Talk recordings and slides can be found \href{https://www.birs.ca/events/2023/5-day-workshops/23w5151}{online}.
