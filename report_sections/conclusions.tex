A common experience since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic has been
that we often meet people first virtually, and potentially never
in-person.  A large proportion of CANMOD's co-applicants had never met
in-person before the BIRS workshop, and the opportunity to do so---for
those of us who were able to attend in Banff---was greatly
appreciated.  For both in-person and virtual participants, the
presentations and discussions were extremely valuable, and the
connections made during the meeting will influence research and public
health policy-making in the coming years.  These types of
events---which generate enthusiasm among participants for continued
interactions between academics, govenment scientists, and
policy-makers---are critical to the vision for EIDM modelling in Canada
described in a white paper \cite{Lewi+23} drafted by several of the
attendees together with members of other EIDM networks at an earlier
BIRS meeting in January 2023.  We are certain that all the attendees
at the CANMOD BIRS workshop in November 2023 are looking forward to
continuing to contribute to the realization of that vision!
